# Car-Traffic-Game

Game made during the "Computer Graphics" course given by the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP). Made together with Matheus Cabana. 

This is a traffic game, where we have to teach traffic laws for children. In the game, the player starts with 1000 points that will decrease as the player does infractions, such as: - Run over pedestrians - Hit other cars, or houses and trees. The player gains points as he collects the CFC notebooks scattered on the streets of the city. The ultimate goal is to get the driver's license which is at the end of the city.

3D game made in Unity, using the C# language.
